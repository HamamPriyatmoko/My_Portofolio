# RENTAL APP

This application is an application that I made based on the problems that exist around, Motorcycle rental is a problem experienced by local and international tourists, many tourists are looking for a place to rent a motorbike, but they themselves do not know where to look for it, so this application was made to support the needs of tourists easily. With this application, tourists will not be confused to find a motorbike rental place, because with this application, tourists can order a motorbike rental from their own place and the motorbike will be delivered to their destination.

Rental Motor is an application that I created with one of my friends as a final project from a database-based application development course, which includes several operations such as create, read, update, delete and the database used is mysql. I was responsible for implementing the create read update delete functionality and creating the database. After that I developed it myself when I took the entrance test to become a teaching assistant, I added search and filter/category features.
